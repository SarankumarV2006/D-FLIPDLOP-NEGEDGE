# D-FLIPDLOP-NEGEDGE

**AIM:**

To implement  D flipflop using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

**D Flip-Flop**

D flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, D latch operates with enable signal. That means, the output of D flip-flop is insensitive to the changes in the input, D except for active transition of the clock signal. The circuit diagram of D flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has single input D and two outputs Qtt & Qttâ€™. The operation of D flip-flop is similar to D Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable. The following table shows the state table of D flip-flop.

Therefore, D flip-flop always Hold the information, which is available on data input, D of earlier positive transition of clock signal. From the above state table, we can directly write the next state equation as Qt+1t+1 = D

Next state of D flip-flop is always equal to data input, D for every positive transition of the clock signal. Hence, D flip-flops can be used in registers, shift registers and some of the counters.

**Procedure**


1. The Flip-Flop operates with only positive clock transitions.
2. The output of the D Flip-Flop is insensitive to the changes in the input D.
3. The operation of the Flip-Flop is shown in the figure, where the input D and the clock signal (clk) are shown.
4. This circuit has a single input D and two outputs Q and Q'.
5. The outputs Q and Q' only change when a positive transition of the clock signal is applied.

The procedure to understand this logic diagram would be:

1. Understand the basic operation of a Flip-Flop, where the output state changes based on the input and clock signal.
2. Analyze the specific operation of this D Flip-Flop, where the output is insensitive to the changes in the input D, and only the positive clock transitions cause the output to change state.
3. Trace the input D and clock signal (clk) to understand how they affect the output Q and Q'.
